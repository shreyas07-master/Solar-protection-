# Solar-protection-
IOT based Solar protection system

Nowadays the India as became with the country of numerous solar implementation and the robotics and automation with the iot and embedded system with the advanced futuristic Technology has made

With each solar panel to be installed, India reduces its carbon footprint, empowers rural communities, and strengthens its path toward energy independence.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:  30% to 40% of the solar panels will get damaged due to the many natural & phenomenal reasons like stone rain,,thermal shock heavy rain & algae growth etc 
with this parameters and disturbing agents we are resolutioning the most fascinating idea which is implemented in/on solar panel come out of this all cautions.


This project saves the solar panel by enhancing it's working efficiency, accuracy, healthiness and consistency of solar energy conversion to generating good electricity to the industries & to the country which also increases the economical growth in the electricity and network integration in India.

The Greater thought we have that " From desert sands in Rajasthan to rooftops in remote villages, India’s solar revolution should be lighting lives with every sunrise ."

It is a best idea to integrate, implement and install this system as a default in the solar panels which can be operated by IOT control systems by using the ESP 32 microcontrollers and other Wi-Fi & bluetooth related microcontrollers and  by a single command from a user or operator it can perfrom actuation in a solar energy plant.
